There once was a boy named Harry, brought up in good-old Texas.
He used to play with his friends and play around, once one of his friends disappeared in front of him.
He was really stressed and reported it to the local authorities, however nobody would listen to him.
Everyone thought it was really bizarre considering the fact, that his friend didn't even exist.
