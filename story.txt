There once was a boy named Harry, brought up in good-old Texas.
He used to play with his friends and play around, once one of his friends disappeared in front of him.
He was really stressed and reported it to the local authorities, however nobody would listen to him.
Everyone thought it was really bizarre considering the fact, that his friend didn't even exist.

Harry was worried and his friends and family encouraged him to seek medical attention. 
He went to see a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
This new diagnosis was scary and Harry wasn't sure what to do next.

Since nobody believed that his friend had disappeared, he decided to take
matters into his own hands and search for him on his own. Harry was from
Austin, but the last time he had seen his friend was on a day trip to Waco,
so he decided that he would start there first.
